This repository contains the source of the website https://caretaker.passcod.name,
which codifies a free software management model aimed at changing the expectations
on and from maintainers, contributors, helpers, issue reporters, and users, in the
goal of redistributing burden and effort more fairly, for small to medium projects.

To read more about this model, [read the website][caretaker].

To discuss the model, use the issues on this [repository].

To use the model, include something like the following paragraph:

> You may contribute: this project operates on [the Caretaker model][caretaker]
> rather than usual open source rules.

(And of course, apply the model!)

To remix, modify, fork, or otherwise adapt the model, you need to:

- choose a different name, and
- state it is a modification on this one, with a link back, and
- respect the license.

To redistribute or host the model elsewhere, and generally for all purposes
including the above, the license applies:

The term "free software" makes no association with the Free Software / GNU
movement, foundations, principles, nor organisations, and the term "open source"
similarly makes no association with the Open Source Software movement,
foundations, principles, nor organisations.

There's just a dearth of _other_ words that convey the same base meaning (that of
work in the open, for some definition of free, or with some definition of freedom)
that aren't obscure or also already associated with such movements, principles, &c
