This repository contains the source of the website https://caretaker.passcod.name, which codifies an
open software management system “addon” aimed at changing the expectations on and from developers,
contributors, helpers, and users, in the goal of redistributing burden and effort more fairly, for
small to medium projects.

To learn more about this system, [read the website][caretaker].

To discuss the system, use the issues on this [repository].

To use the system, include something like the following paragraph:

> You may contribute: this project supports the [Caretaker System][caretaker]
> of contributions as well as usual open source rules.

(And of course, you and your project should itself apply the system!)

To remix, modify, fork, or otherwise adapt the system, you need to:

- choose a different name, and
- state it is a modification on this one, with a link back, and
- respect the license.
