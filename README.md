This repository contains the source of the website https://caretaker.passcod.name,
which codifies an open software management model aimed at changing the expectations
on and from developers, contributors, helpers, and users, in the goal of
redistributing burden and effort more fairly, for small to medium projects.

To learn more about this model, [read the website][caretaker].

To discuss the model, use the issues on this [repository].

To use the model, include something like the following paragraph:

> You may contribute: this project operates on [the Caretaker model][caretaker]
> rather than usual open source rules.

(And of course, apply the model!)

To remix, modify, fork, or otherwise adapt the model, you need to:

- choose a different name, and
- state it is a modification on this one, with a link back, and
- respect the license.

To redistribute or host the model elsewhere, and generally for all purposes
including the above, the license applies:
